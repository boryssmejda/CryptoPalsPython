# CryptoPalsPython

This are my solutions to the [Cryptopals cryptographic challenges][1].
I solved them using Python 3.10.

## How to configure and run

TODO: I need add some solved challenges to make any changes in this field.

## My Opinion on the tasks

In my opinion the set of tasks is a great way to understand
a modern cryptography and also improve the programming skills.
I would definitely recommend this set to everyone, not only beginners,
but also people with much longer job experience.
